# CrypKit

## Introduction
CrypKit is a Python-based, command-line tool designed to offer a straightforward way to perform various cryptographic operations. Its user-friendly interface and visually appealing design make it accessible and simple to use compared to many other CLI cryptography tools. The application is designed to be expandable, allowing for the easy addition of new features without overwhelming the user.

## Features
- **Key Generation**: Generate RSA key pairs and manage them effectively.
- **File Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt files using RSA.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilizes Python packages like Rich and InquirerPy to create an engaging and interactive CLI experience.


## List of Future Releases
